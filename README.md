 ## Features
- [x] It does not re-render the background content while manipulating with the sheet
- [x] iOS and macOS support
- [x] **dark** and **light** scheme support
- [x] Observing sheet positions on change if you need to react on it
- [x] Responsive for any size change It's important for macOS while window size changing
- [x] Customize component with your own specs

## Creation

Put the component into an absolute coordinate space like *ZStack* or *GeometryReader* and just pass a content that's it to start with sheet drawer.

```swift
        ZStack {
            BottomSheet(content: Color.clear.background(.thinMaterial))
        }
```

### Builder
You can use builder methods to change some specs

* `hideDragButton` - Hide drag button
* `withoutAnimation` - Turn off animation

```swift
        ZStack {
            BottomSheet(content: Color.clear.background(.thinMaterial))
            .hideDragButton()
            .withoutAnimation()
        }
```


### Optional

* `shift` - Visible height of the sheet drawer
* `topIndentation` - Space from the very top to the max height drawer can reach

* `draggerHeight` - Space sensitive for dragging
* `dragThresholdToAct` - Dragging length after which trigger move to the next level depending on the direction of moving



### Observing sheet positions
Observe sheet positions on change if you need to react on it in the external context of the component. For example to update layout of the drawer content according a new size of the height.
Position **BottomSheetPosition** is passed with **height** of the sheet. 
**height** - is enum associated with value of type *CGFloat*

```swift

    @State private var position: BottomSheetPosition
    
        BottomSheet(
            content: SheetContentView(position: $position)
        )
        .onPositionChanged{
            position = $0
        }
```

| Position | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**up(CGFloat)**| At the top |
|**middle(CGFloat)**| At the middle |
|**down(CGFloat)**| At the bottom |
